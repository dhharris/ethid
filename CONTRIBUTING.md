If you wish to contribute to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make with the owners. This can be done via email.

## Pull Request Process
1. Make sure that any build or install dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. After making changes, update the README.md detailing the changes made. This would include new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters. 
3. After having one of the owners sign-off, you may merge the Pull Request. If you don't have the power to do the merge yourself, the reviewer will do it for you.
